  Since I began programming, I’ve worked on a lot of interesting and challenging projects
  These projects have been for both personal applications and as part of my involvement
  in extracurriculars in university. Below are some of my projects that I am most proud of.
projects:

      I built this project for Spike On Site Solutions, a construction company in
      Toronto, Canada. I worked with a product manager and a designer to create
      a web app that allows them to better manage their internal operations. The
      application used NextJS for server-side rendering of React components,
      PostgreSQL for the data-layer, and Docker for containerized deployment.
  - title: Task Tree

      I made this project to familiarize myself with Ruby on Rails, and to explore
      some cool Ruby gems. The application is a task manager that lets users
      nest tasks inside each other to create detailed and organized todo lists. I built
      this using a GraphQL API (through the graphql-ruby gem) and server-side
      rendered react (through the react_on_rails gem).
  - title: QHacks Website & Dashboard

      In my time at Queen’s University, I got involved with the school’s annual
      hackathon, QHacks. After attending in second year as a hacker, I decided to
      join the executive team the next year where I worked on a team of 3 developers
      building tools for the hackathon itself. These tools included the GatsbyJS-
      powered website and the dashboard that was built using Node, React, and
      GraphQL. I focused primarily on the backend of this application which included
      migrating the data-layer from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, migrating the API from
      REST to GraphQL, and providing a large test suite using Jest.

      This project is very near and dear to my heart as it was the first web app I
      ever shipped. The app connects to Spotify’s API to play a random song every
      30 seconds and allow users to like or dislike every song. A list is kept of the
      most liked and disliked songs which is persisted using MongoDB. I originally
      deployed this website using Amazon EC2, however my free trial ran out, but
      the code is still available on my GitHub.
