          Hi, Iâ€™m Joey!
          Iâ€™m a software engineer from Toronto, Canada.
          My passions include music (playing and listening), basketball, travelling, books, and movies.
          I have lived in 4 countries and 5 cities and travelled to over 30 countries.
          I can play multiple instruments by ear including guitar, piano, and drums.
          I made this website to show some of my projects, experience, and open source contributions to friends, family, and potential employers.
          If you want to know more about me, feel free to get in contact with me through the following platforms:
